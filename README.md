## How to contribute?
If you would like to add to the project please do but I would ask that you create an issue in GitHub for the feature, bug fix.

After creating the issue create a branch to work on this should have the issue number and name for the issue as the name.

After your ready to publish the branch create a pull request into the test branch where it will be tested.

After it's passed testing it will be merged into master and tagged.

Then I will publish the version to Microsoft.
